# Cinematica — Landing Page

Cinematica is a minimal demo landing page for reviewing movies (inspired by Fragrantica).

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies (optional; used for local static server):

   npm install

2. Add your TMDB API key:
   - Open `script.js` and replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY` with your TMDB API key.

3. Run locally:

   npm start

Or open `index.html` directly in a browser.

Notes:
- This is an initial landing page showing now-playing / popular movies and TV using TheMovieDB images and endpoints.
- We intentionally keep the UI clean and modern. Next steps: movie detail pages, user reviews, auth.
